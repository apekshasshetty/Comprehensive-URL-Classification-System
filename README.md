# Comprehensive_URL_Classification_System

The Comprehensive URL Classification System is a machine learning-based project designed to accurately identify and categorize URLs as benign, malware, phishing, or defacement. This enhances cybersecurity measures by providing users with real-time risk assessments.

## Features

- **Real-time URL classification**
- **Categorizes URLs into benign, malware, phishing, or defacement**
- **Comparative analysis of multiple machine learning models**
- **Simple web interface using Flask**

## Models Used

A comparative analysis is done on 6 models, and the best-performing model is used. The models include:

- Extra Trees Classifier (ET)
- Random Forest Classifier (RF)
- Decision Tree Classifier (DT)
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KN)
- AdaBoost Classifier (AB)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)

## User Interface
